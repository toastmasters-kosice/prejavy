	HLAVNA MYSLIENKA: pushing through fear is less frightening than living with it

UVOD
some fear is instinctual and healthy, and keeps us alert to trouble. The rest—the part that holds us back from personal growth.
If you have not been successful in dealing with fear, you interpreted fear as a signal to retreat rather as green light to move ahead.
	Why should I put myself through all the discomfort that comes with taking risks? Why dont I just go on living my life the way I have been living it?

JADRO
Janet’s still waiting for the fear to go away. She had always planned to return to college once her children were in school, but she now
notices it’s been four years since her youngest child entered first grade. New excuses have popped up since that time: “I want to be
here when the children come home from school”; “We really don’t have the money”; “My husband will feel neglected.”
Although it is true that certain logistics would have to be worked out, that is not the reason for her hesitation. In fact, her husband is willing to
help her in any way he can. He is concerned about her restlessness, and often encourages her to fulfill her lifelong dream of becoming a fashion
designer.
Each time Janet thinks about calling the local college to set up an interview, something stops her. “When I’m not so frightened, then I’ll make
the call”; “When I feel a little better about myself, then I’ll make the call.” Most likely Janet is going to wait a very long time.
The problem is that her thinking is all mixed up. The logic she uses automatically programs her for failure. She will never break the fear barrier
until she is made aware of her faulty thinking; she simply does not “see” what is obvious to those who are out there doing it.

ZAVER
AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERY ONE OF YOUR FEARS IS SIMPLY THE FEAR THAT YOU CAN’T HANDLE WHATEVER LIFE MAY BRING YOU.
IF YOU KNEW YOU COULD HANDLE ANYTHING THAT CAME YOUR WAY, WHAT WOULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE TO FEAR?
The answer is: NOTHING!
I know you are probably not jumping up and down for joy just yet, but believe me when I tell you that I have just given you a great piece of news.
What I have just told you means you can handle all your fears without having to control anything in the outside world. This should be a tremendous relief. 
	You no longer have to control what your mate does, what your friends do, what your children do, or what your boss does. You don’t have to control what happens at an interview, what happens at your job, what happens in your new career, what happens to your money, or what happens in the stock market.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO DIMINISH YOUR FEAR IS TO DEVELOP MORE TRUST IN YOUR ABILITY TO HANDLE WHATEVER COMES YOUR WAY!
