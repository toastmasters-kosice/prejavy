CO MA NA TOM BAVI A NAPLNA
•	The one thing above all else is the balance between utility and creativity. As in, it is both a practical skill and a creative outlet. 
•	you feel powerful as a programmer — at least in terms of where technology stands right now. Kids in their basement can create applications that turn them into billionaires. Ignore the money for a second, think about the level of power that has put in those people’s hands. That’s a single application. A single idea.
In the end, programming is just another form of inscribing our imagination onto something that currently has a huge impact on the future of our species.
•	Coding is not just typing some cryptic lines on the computer, it solves real world issues. Makes our lives easier: Don’t want to drive in traffic, we have Uber. Want to pre-book a villa, we have Airbnb. Want to order food, we have plenty of apps for that as well.
•	The feeling I got when I saw the output displayed correctly is indescribable. I put in hundreds of lines of code, researching, practicing, looking at examples and tutorials, asking questions on stackoverflow. All day 7 days a week.
•	a key difference between computer languages and human languages is that computer languages are absolutely precise and unambiguous. If you spell a command incorrectly, or forget a semicolon, it is likely that your whole code will fail. Unlike a human conversation, computers are extremely fussy about both spelling and punctuation. The big advantage of this unambiguity is that you can be certain that if you get your code right the computer will do exactly what you want. Unlike human conversation, which can often result in unexpected outcomes, computers will always do exactly what is commanded of them, whether you like it or not. the computer won’t make a ‘best guess’about what you meant; if you get your code even slightly wrong, nothing will happen at all.

Almost all jobs today require a fair bit of time working with a computer. You likely have to do a range of similar tasks each day, including working with email, creating and managing documents, and searching the web. Almost all of these tasks can be made more efficient with a strong knowledge of how the software and operating system you are using works.
Initially, simply using keyboard shortcuts will likely save you several minutes each day, and more importantly will start you thinking about how the software you are using works, and how your workflow could be improved.
learning how computers work gives you the power to absorb new software and hardware into your workflow, making you more adaptable and essentially future-proofing your career. understanding the tools that you and your colleagues use every day enables you to use them more effectively.
You might be thinking, ‘but I can do everything I need to with my computer and phone without needing to code.’ In the last 30 years or so highly user-friendly operating systems such as Windows and MacOS (and Android and iOS on mobile devices) have meant that we no longer have to write code to control a computer. Advanced Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have been developed so that anyone could approach a computer or phone and start using it straight away. This has been a great leap forward in usability, but it also means that many people aren’t aware of the power that they have at their fingertips if they go beyond the everyday software like Word and Chrome.
Every piece of software you use has been written, in code, by someone or, more likely, a group of people. Every time you issue an instruction to Siri, or enter a web address in a browser, a few (or a few thousand) lines of code are executed to answer your question or load a website. There is no magic behind this, it is simply the hard graft of thousands of developers and billions of transistors doing what they are told.
Learning to code gives you complete power over these transistors – you can bend them to your will by creating your own software, or automating processes to save you hours every day. Coding is very much like a super-power, in that it enables you to use equipment you already have in a whole new way.

Communication with IT dept.
Regardless of your current fluency with technology, it is likely that you need to communicate with technical people fairly regularly about things that you don’t entirely understand. Whether it is trying to get some content added to the company website, getting some software installed on your computer or removing the tweet you accidentally posted on the company account, greater technical knowledge can make every aspect of those conversations much more straightforward.
As well as becoming more familiar with the terminology that technical people use (which really isn’t as complicated or mysterious as it seems), you will know the fundamental nature of how computer systems work and fit together. This means that every time you come across a new system, or piece of software, you will be able to zero in on the key functions and properties, enabling you to get to grips with how it works, and discuss it confidently.

Become better customer for IT
Further to understanding how software works, learning to code gives you an awareness of what is involved in building a webform, or adding a feature to an app. It is likely at some point in your career that you will need to work directly with coders to add features to the company website, customize the software you use every day, or even to create a new app from scratch.
If you aren’t aware of what is necessary to build a website, app or individual feature, you are open to either overpaying for what you are getting, or not getting exactly what you wanted. Knowing what it takes to write some code gives you power in negotiations and while managing a project, as well as the ability to get the job done quickly and to budget. -> STORKA zabuchli sme si dvere, vypytali od nas 25 eur za par sekund roboty. A keby pytali aj 100 alebo 150 eur, tak by sme ich zaplatili, lebo jednoducho sa do toho nevyzname

Online presence is becoming more and more important
Eighty per cent of employers Google job applicants before inviting them for interview. Take a moment to search your own name and see what comes up. Is it what you would want a potential employer to see?
Creating a blog, portfolio site, or a simple site for a project you’ve undertaken or ebook you have written enables you to control what your future boss sees, and helps you stand out as an applicant. A web presence matters and learning to control yours will put you ahead of 95 per cent of the population.

Useful in starting business
Coding skills enable you to start any business you like, but they also enable you to partner with people and provide the technical expertise that all new companies need. Whether or not you want to start a company today, knowing that the opportunity is always there is incredibly exciting, and we will look at the process in some detail later in this book. What entrepreneurial opportunities could learning to code bring you?
For me, it was the combination of coding and teaching that worked so well, but for you it might be coding and law, coding and accountancy, or coding and yoga (we’ll see an example for that later on). Being an expert in a separate field lets you know what people like you want, what problems they have, and gives you insight into how those problems might be solved. Learning to code gives you the tools to actually solve them.

These are just some of the very practical ways that learning to code can improve your prospects, make you more valuable as an employee and give your opportunities for greater freedom and career advancement.

Coding can be a huge amount of fun, and very satisfying as you overcome problems and complete challenges. You may feel that you are not learning anything new in your day-to-day role, and learning to code gives you that buzz of acquiring new skills and understanding that you may not have felt since school or university.
If you enjoy problem solving and creating things, you will likely find great enjoyment in completing a project, fixing bugs and creating websites and apps.

Steve Jobs famously said, ‘I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.’ That is a final, and essential, benefit – learning code forces you to approach problems logically and analytically, asking the right questions and testing your solutions to see if they work. And that is a skill that will benefit you in all aspects of your life.

I have found that learning to code gives people a great feeling of empowerment. Having the ability to create digital products such as apps and websites is something very few people can do, and brings so much potential into your life. It has completely changed my life, and it can do the same for you.
