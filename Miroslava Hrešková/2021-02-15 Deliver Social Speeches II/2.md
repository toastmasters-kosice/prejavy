Acceptance Speech
You may be called upon to speak when accepting a prize, honor, or award. The opportunity to give an acceptance speech is a privilege. If the award or honor is a surprise, it may be difficult to recall your intended speech. Prepare in advance by making notes and practicing so the opportunity to speak is managed with respect and humility.
Express your gratitude and be genuine when composing an acceptance speech. This speech is your opportunity to demonstrate why you are deserving of the honor being bestowed on you. Let your behavior at the event and during your speech demonstrate your highest nature. Recognize the people who may have helped you achieve success. Be sure to respect the time allotted for your acceptance speech and end on time.
