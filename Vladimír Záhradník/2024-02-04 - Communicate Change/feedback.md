Strong start - We are at the crossroads..... I would have liked to see a LONG pause after that. Make us wonder what you are going to say. You used very concrete examples of how to improve a Toastmaster meeting which was effective. Unfortunately, after that you relied on several slides which I could NOT read. I welcome very much the idea of getting us on board with easy-Speak. You sold that well even offering to give a workshop. - Maria Teresa

Sergey:
- Celkovo sa mu prejav páčil, vysoko zhodnotil kvalitu prejavu a prípravu.
- Chýbalo mu tam viac emócií a inšpirácie. Napríklad dať do Call To Action viac otvorených otázok, nabudiť tých ľudí. Na tomto budem pracovať.
