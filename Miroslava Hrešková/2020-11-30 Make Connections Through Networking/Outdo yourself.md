It was dark and chilly autumn evening. Pretty much as this one. I was walking down the street. Holding my phone in freezing hands, looking at the display, trying to figure out which way to go. 
So I am going to latin dance class for women. Crazy idea considering I am not very good at dancing. Coordinating my legs with my hands is very difficult for me, almost impossible. But my goal here is to get out of the house, try something new, meet a bunch of people and hopefully make some new friends.
Many self-described introverts feel that the networking field is just not built for them to successfully play the game. Walking into the room like they own it, striking up a conversation with a stranger, and dazzling people with their ease and charm — those are the “perfect” ingredients that seem to be required in order to win at networking.
New place, new people, new activity – possibly hobby. Too many news. It makes me very nervous. 
What started with dancing classes, continued with aquarelle workshop, cooking and baking lessons, programming courses, social media webinars, photography school, 
study sessions, public speaking club
1. Prepare
Before you head into your next social event, spend a few minutes thinking about what you want to learn from others. Have a few questions ready to ask new people, such as “How did you get started in your career?” or “What are you passionate about?” If being put on the spot makes you nervous, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with writing questions down and practicing ahead of time. Also think about what you want to share about yourself—you can’t rely on another person to carry the conversation for you!
2. Find a Conference Buddy
You don’t always have to go at it alone—having a buddy can make large events much less intimidating. So bring a colleague or friend to your next networking event or conference. If you do have to fly solo, try to reach out and make just one connection. That way, you’ll have someone to sit with during lunch breaks and someone to wave hello to and introduce to others. And you’ll probably be surprised at how much fun you’ll have!
3. Be That Person
Remember that most people in the room at any given networking event feel the same way you do: scared to death. So, instead of dwelling on how scary it is to start a conversation, think about how by doing so you’ll be helping other people feel more comfortable. Maybe that girl alone at the table doesn’t know anyone either and is just hoping that someone will come talk to her. Be that person! (“Have you been to this before?” is always a great opening line.)
4. Be Present
Once you do start a conversation, it can be tough to relax if you’re continuously worried about what to say next and what the other person is thinking. So try shifting the focus to your new acquaintance, instead. Ask lots of questions and practice your listening skills!
5. Smile
You don’t always have to initiate—but if you’re hiding against the wall with your arms crossed over your chest, you’re not giving off a very approachable vibe, either. So try to relax, smile, and look as warm and casual as you can—it’ll open the door for someone to walk up to you and start the conversation.

Build confidence - By continually putting yourself out there and meeting new people, you’re effectively stepping outside your comfort zone and building invaluable social skills and self-confidence that you can take with you anywhere. The more you network, the more you’ll grow and learn how to make lasting connections.
I have realized this: It is OK if it makes you wanna run the opposite direction. But the important thing is to try. Accept the fear and go for it.
