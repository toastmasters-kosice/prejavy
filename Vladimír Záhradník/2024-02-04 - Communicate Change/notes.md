# Notes: Open Up! (Project: Communicate Change)

@Sergey Radchenko the title of my speech will be Open Up!

I will discuss the problems I've been facing when coming to BOSC:
- I don't have direct contact with club members because they're in ukrainian-speaking Telegram group
- Roles assignment works through the club president which is inefficient and makes it hard for people to self-assign their roles

The goal of the speech:
- Open up the club to English speaking members and guests
- Use easySpeak as a meeting planner which is familiar to many potential members

### Who wrote this software and can my club use it too?
The base engine to all of this is the phpbb 'bulletin board' with extensive additions - more detail at the bottom of these FAQ.

In my business life I insist on superb administration and I could not bear to watch our club VPE struggle with no tools or the wrong tools in what is essentially an administrative nightmare. Even worse there was a risk I may be asked to do it! So I created the Toastmaster automation software as a personal project.

Of course you may use it at your club and I will be pleased to help you get started.
It is designed to be multi-club, multi-lingual and multi-timezone. If you would like to organise the translation for an additional language please get in touch.
