# Notes: Connect with Storytelling

Message: Always find your WHYs: My journey to Division Director

Intro:
I always keep saying: Toastmasters is a ride. Sometimes we hit some bumps but when I look back, the ride brings smile to my face.
I currently serve as a division director, supervising over 19 clubs in Slovakia and Ukraine. Something I wouldn't imagine two years ago.

Outro / CTA:
Finding the WHY is the key. When you have you WHY, Toastmasters will always give you more than it takes from you.

Outline:
- My home club is my playground
- Covid and my sabbatical from Toastmasters
- A little push
- Club Officers Training 2023
- Interviews
- Withdrawal of my application
- District Conference in Bucharest
- Building a strong team with Nataly and Vadym

25.6.2023: Division B (B1, B2) Collaboration

Hello Vadym and Nataly,

In a couple of days I will take the role of the Division B Director. How I got into this position is actually a funny story which I can tell someday if you'd be interested :)

From what I heard it seems that the communication between area directors from Ukraine and the past division director(s) was not ideal. I'd like to change that. In the upcoming days/weeks I'd like to familiarize myself with my role and what I suppose to do. But I know already that primarily I should support you.

Feel free to reach me out on this email. Over time we can set up a more instant communication channel.

Just for your information, I already established communication with B3 and B4 area directors. However, the communication with them is held in Slovak. That is why I didn't include them into this email. We already have a closed Messenger group where we hold our discussions.

I can understand some Ukrainian but as you can probably guess, it's not on a converstion level so we have to stick to English.

Your first big task is to organize the Club Officer Training. If you need something from me just let me know. I'll try to assist. At least let me know the date of the training so that I can report further to the district.

Cheers,
Vladimir
