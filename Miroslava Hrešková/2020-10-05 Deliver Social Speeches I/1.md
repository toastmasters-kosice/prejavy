Toast

A toast is the action of raising your glass in honor of someone or something. Toasts are typically given at weddings or other noteworthy events. It is important to remember that the most significant person at the event is the person or persons you are honoring. Though you are the speaker, you want audience members to focus on the honoree.

When composing your toast, create a speech that fits the occasion in both mood and language. For formal gatherings, a good toast is dignified, although some humor may be appropriate.

For informal occasions where guests are likely to be acquainted with one another, toasts can be lighter in tone and phrased to fit the relaxed atmosphere. It is generally best to avoid clich√©s, as they may be perceived as insincere or shallow
