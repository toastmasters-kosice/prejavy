My first event that I used as my networking opportunity was a latin dance class for women. Crazy idea considering I am not very good at dancing. Doing some steps with my legs? OK. Doing some hand movements? Sure. But doing it all together? Very difficult for me, almost impossible. 

I was very nervous. Too many new things. New activity, new place, new people… Walking down that street and thinking about it made me all dizzy. I am not a very outgoing person. Socializing does not come naturally to me. But my goal was get out of the house, try something new, meet a bunch of people and hopefully make some friends.

Networking is a great way how to meet new people. 
1. Get fresh ideas - Your network can be an excellent source of new perspectives and ideas to help you in your role. Exchanging information on challenges, experiences and goals is a key benefit of networking because it allows you to gain new insights that you may not have otherwise thought of. Similarly, offering helpful ideas to a contact is an excellent way to build your reputation as an innovative thinker.
2. Gain a different perspective - It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day of your professional realm and end up in a rut. By talking to others in your field or people with expertise in a particular area, you can gain insights that only come from viewing a situation with fresh eyes. Asking for opinions from contacts you trust or admire can help you see things in a new light and overcome roadblocks that you might not have known how to circumvent otherwise.
3. Get career advice and support - Gaining the advice of experienced peers is an important benefit of networking. Discussing common challenges and opportunities opens the door to valuable suggestions and guidance. Offering genuine assistance to your contacts also sets a strong foundation for receiving support in return when you need it.
However, many people feel that the networking is just not built for them to successfully play the game. Walking into the room like they own it, striking up a conversation with a stranger, and dazzling people with their ease and charm — those are the “perfect” ingredients that seem to be required in order to win at networking. 

I have discovered some tricks how to make it easier for yourself:
1. Prepare
Before you head into your next social event, spend a few minutes thinking about what you want to learn from others. Have a few questions ready to ask new people, such as “How did you get started in your career?” or “What are you passionate about?” If being put on the spot makes you nervous, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with writing questions down and practicing ahead of time. Also think about what you want to share about yourself—you can’t rely on another person to carry the conversation for you!
2. Smile
You don’t always have to initiate—but if you’re hiding against the wall with your arms crossed over your chest, you’re not giving off a very approachable vibe, either. So try to relax, smile, and look as warm and casual as you can—it’ll open the door for someone to walk up to you and start the conversation.
3. Point of view
Remember that most people in the room at any given networking event feel the same way you do: scared to death. So, instead of dwelling on how scary it is to start a conversation, think about how by doing so you’ll be helping other people feel more comfortable. Maybe that girl alone at the table doesn’t know anyone either and is just hoping that someone will come talk to her. Be that person! (“Have you been to this before?” is always a great opening line.)
4. Aks questions and listen
Once you do start a conversation, it can be tough to relax if you’re continuously worried about what to say next and what the other person is thinking. So try shifting the focus to your new acquaintance, instead. Ask lots of questions and practice your listening skills!

Build confidence - By continually putting yourself out there and meeting new people, you’re effectively stepping outside your comfort zone and building invaluable social skills and self-confidence that you can take with you anywhere. The more you network, the more you’ll grow and learn how to make lasting connections.

I have realized this: It is OK if it makes you wanna run the opposite direction. But the important thing is to try. Accept the fear and go for it.
