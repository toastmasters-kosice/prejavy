Networks enable you to offer more and have more impact.
A network is a set of relationships that you depend on to get things done to get ahead in your career and to develop professionally.
“Just Like Me” convenience networks are not the most effective — we need a diversity of ideas, inputs, information, and resources.
There is strength in “weak ties” — in our relationships with people that we don’t know that well or that we don’t see very often.
THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF NETWORKS:
• Operational — relationships with people at work that allow you to get today’s work done
• Personal — relationships of your choosing, people you like to hang out with informally
• Strategic — (most important network for career advancement) relationships that help you envision your future, sell your ideas, and get the information and resources you need
GREAT STRATEGIC NETWORKS ARE:
• Broad — connected to a diverse range of people
• Connective — linked or bridged across people and groups
that would not otherwise connect
• Dynamic — responsive and adaptive, growing as you grow
Building a strong strategic network is challenging for anybody but it can be particularly challenging for women, especially in male-dominated organizations and fields
STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING EFFECTIVE NETWORKS
• Engage in activities both inside and outside your organization
• Connect through people you already know
• Focus on and develop the value you bring to your network
• Prioritize and invest in a few activities — favor active over passive networking 

At its root, networking is relationship-building. Its by-product often leads to career connections or new opportunities, but the act of networking is really about connecting with someone on a deeper level. How extroverts and introverts go about this may differ, but relationship-building is something we all do.

Get fresh ideas
Your network can be an excellent source of new perspectives and ideas to help you in your role. Exchanging information on challenges, experiences and goals is a key benefit of networking because it allows you to gain new insights that you may not have otherwise thought of. Similarly, offering helpful ideas to a contact is an excellent way to build your reputation as an innovative thinker.
Get career advice and support
Gaining the advice of experienced peers is an important benefit of networking. Discussing common challenges and opportunities opens the door to valuable suggestions and guidance. Offering genuine assistance to your contacts also sets a strong foundation for receiving support in return when you need it.
Build confidence
By continually putting yourself out there and meeting new people, you’re effectively stepping outside your comfort zone and building invaluable social skills and self-confidence that you can take with you anywhere. The more you network, the more you’ll grow and learn how to make lasting connections.
Gain a different perspective
It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day of your professional realm and end up in a rut. By talking to others in your field or people with expertise in a particular area, you can gain insights that only come from viewing a situation with fresh eyes. Asking for opinions from contacts you trust or admire can help you see things in a new light and overcome roadblocks that you might not have known how to circumvent otherwise.
Develop long-lasting personal relationships
Of course, the point of networking is to develop and nurture professional relationships, but some of the strongest and most long-standing friendships are borne from work connections. Your networking contacts are probably like-minded people with similar goals as your own, so it’s not unlikely that your professional support network will spill over into your personal friendships.

Many self-described introverts feel that the networking field is just not built for them to successfully play the game. Walking into the room like they own it, striking up a conversation with a stranger, and dazzling people with their ease and charm — those are the “perfect” ingredients that seem to be required in order to win at networking.
Introversion and extraversion merely point to the way individuals prefer to recharge. According to the Myers-Briggs Foundation, introverts tend to build up their energy in a quiet space by themselves, while extroverts get energized when surrounded by people and activity. It's important to remember that introversion, just as extraversion, is simply a preference and a tool. Those who understand it, accept it, and create a strategy to use it for maximum benefit may find that introversion is the secret sauce for boosting their careers.  

1. Prepare
Before you head into your next social event, spend a few minutes thinking about what you want to learn from others. Have a few questions ready to ask new people, such as “How did you get started in your career?” or “What are you passionate about?” If being put on the spot makes you nervous, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with writing questions down and practicing ahead of time. Also think about what you want to share about yourself—you can’t rely on another person to carry the conversation for you!
2. Find a Conference Buddy
You don’t always have to go at it alone—having a buddy can make large events much less intimidating. So bring a colleague or friend to your next networking event or conference. If you do have to fly solo, try to reach out and make just one connection. That way, you’ll have someone to sit with during lunch breaks and someone to wave hello to and introduce to others. And you’ll probably be surprised at how much fun you’ll have!
3. Be That Person
Remember that most people in the room at any given networking event feel the same way you do: scared to death. So, instead of dwelling on how scary it is to start a conversation, think about how by doing so you’ll be helping other people feel more comfortable. Maybe that girl alone at the table doesn’t know anyone either and is just hoping that someone will come talk to her. Be that person! (“Have you been to this before?” is always a great opening line.)
4. Be Present
Once you do start a conversation, it can be tough to relax if you’re continuously worried about what to say next and what the other person is thinking. So try shifting the focus to your new acquaintance, instead. Ask lots of questions and practice your listening skills!
5. Smile
You don’t always have to initiate—but if you’re hiding against the wall with your arms crossed over your chest, you’re not giving off a very approachable vibe, either. So try to relax, smile, and look as warm and casual as you can—it’ll open the door for someone to walk up to you and start the conversation.
6. Challenge Yourself
This year, I took on a networking challenge—I met with four people I knew and four people I didn’t know every month. Through these connections, I’ve already gotten an interview and many referrals—not to mention my newfound confidence and a clearer sense of direction in my career. Even if you don’t go this far, think about how you can challenge yourself to step out of your comfort zone just a little bit. It might have unexpected—and great—results.
