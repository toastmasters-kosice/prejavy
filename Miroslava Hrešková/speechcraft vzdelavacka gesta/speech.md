The body can be an effective tool for adding emphasis and clarity to a speaker’s words. It can also be a powerful instrument for convincing an audience of a speaker’s sincerity, passion, and commitment.
Audiences base their judgment of a speaker and the speaker’s message on what they see as well as upon what they hear. A speaker’s stance, facial expressions, hand gestures, effectively the movement of the entire body, communicate more to an audience than actual spoken words.
Body language can also help release nervous energy. Displays of discomfort through nervous habits distract the audience. Speakers can harness this nervous energy and use it to contribute to their message instead.
Movement attracts and keeps an audience’s attention. A stationary speaker is more likely to lose the audience’s interest.

There are three general categories of body language:
Facial expressions
Gestures
Whole body movement

FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
Facial expression is often the key to the meaning behind a message. A speaker’s face communicates more clearly than any other part of the body. An audience will watch a speaker’s face for clues about the speaker’s sincerity, attitude toward the message, and conviction.
Match facial expressions to spoken words. If a speaker talks about a tragedy but his or her face carries an expression of joy, the audience will be confused.
Eye contact is important. In some cultures, avoiding eye contact is considered dishonest, insincere, or disinterested while in others it is an expression of politeness and respect. Whatever the locale, try to make everyone in the audience feel as if you are communicating in a personal manner.
This projects an air of confidence and sincerity.

GESTURES
Gestures reinforce verbal messages or convey a specific thought or emotion. Gestures can be made by any part of the body but most are made with the hands and arms. Avoid nervous mannerisms, such as fidgeting with jewelry, as they tend to distract and annoy an audience. Conversely, strong, purposeful, and complementary gestures strengthen your message and add interest to your presentation.

Three Types of Gestures
Conventional gestures are symbols for words, such as the raised hand for the word “stop” and two raised fingers for the number two.
Descriptive gestures describe the idea you are communicating, such as holding the hands apart to show length or moving the hands and arms to indicate shape.
Emotional gestures suggest feelings, such as shaking a clenched fist to show anger or determination or shrugging the shoulders to show indifference.

Gestures must be a natural outgrowth of the speaker’s thoughts and feelings about his topic.
Poorly planned gestures look stiff and artificial and detract from the speaker’s message.
The frequency and vigor of gestures must be appropriate for the words. Match gestures to the audience size. Use smaller, conversational gestures for small audiences and large, exaggerated gestures for larger ones.

WHOLE BODY MOVEMENT
A speaker’s stance, posture, and movement tell the audience whether the speaker is confident, alert, and in command of the situation.
A relaxed, balanced speaking stance provides a solid starting point from which to gesture or move in any direction; this decreases nervousness and helps the speaker feel poised and comfortable. Varying positions during the presentation can help the speaker provide visual transitions from one point of the speech to the next and can help keep the audience focused.

PRACTICE
Practice using facial expressions, gestures, and whole body movement effectively. Using a mirror or video recording can be useful.

	If you wish, you may devise a short exercise allowing your audience to practice different gestures.

CONCLUSION
Visual presentation is a major part of a speech’s success. Communicating ideas visually through gestures and other body expressions enhances not just a presentation but also the speaker’s overall effectiveness.
