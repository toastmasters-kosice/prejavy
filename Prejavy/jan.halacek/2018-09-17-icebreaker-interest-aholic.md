# Jan Haláček: An interest-aholic
Dear fellow Toastmasters and esteemed guests.

“What is this life, if full of care? We have no time to stand and stare.” These lines from the poem
“Leisure” by W.H. Davies struck me as a fitting way to introduce myself. Because I care about many
things and because I am an INTEREST-AHOLIC.

Why do I say so? If I were standing before you, 15 years ago, I would have introduced myself as a full-
time language student studying at so-and-so university. If it were 10 years ago, I would have introduced
myself as a professional admin employee working for so-and-so company. If it were 5 years ago, I would
have introduced myself as a full-time PhD candidate at Paris Diderot – Paris 7 university at Sorbonne
Cité in Paris. But since receiving my doctorate degree at the end of 2015, I have been at a loss as to what
should I designate myself to be. Would it be a technical writer, an IT enthusiast, a Toastmaster member
or something else? Or would I introduce myself as a budding software developer who aims to keep his
skills honed?

I am sure that some, if not most of us here, would have faced the very same question at some point in
their lives. And why not? All our lives have been filled with a certain identification, a certain structure.
And that’s what we seek to create and reinforce in our lives, whatever we do, wherever we go. We seek
structure. I could elaborate on the need to find structure in our lives but that is not the topic of this
speech. I am.

I call myself an interest-aholic because I have many hobbies: I like swimming, cycling, hiking. I love to
read, practice my EN, FR, RU and ES skills. I am a big IT buff who loves to learn new things about the
latest software trends. But the term interest-aholic can have some thorny or unpleasant connotations —
and in many cases, rightfully so. Having too many interests is associated with high levels of stress,
strained relationships, and an unhealthy work-life balance. But I do not suffer from any of these. And
what is also important is the fact that if I drew the line at, let’s say, 5 hobbies, some of my most
cherished career highlights or life moments wouldn't have occurred. The term interest-aholic has also
some other associated negatives but I choose not to dwell on those. But despite the fact that I am a man
of many interests, I do have the time to stand and stare! Literally so!!! (Stare)

Returning to the subject matter, that is, me, Ján Haláček, I was born an only child, well over 30 years
ago, in Čadca. I have lived most of my life in Banská Bystrica. I had a very sheltered and happy childhood.
I was a rather good student. My childhood and teenage years were spent either hiking, swimming or
other sports or reading comics and novels. I was a voracious reader, a habit that I have retained to the
present. My reading now though consists of mostly non-fiction. My college education was completed in
Banská Štiavnica and I completed a Master’s degree in English and American Studies at the University of
Prešov.

I started my first job at the Chartered Institute of Linguists in London. Work has provided me the
opportunity to travel abroad, both in Europe and the US. After 4 years in the UK, I returned to Slovakia
and did my PhD studies here in Košice. After I completed those, I got employed in AT&T and then I was
hired by an IT company called GlobalLogic where I work until now.

The other activity in my life is regular exercise. This is something that I have tried and instill over the past
3 years. Since I was a teenager I have been interested in building a strong physique. I now try and run 3
times a week, to build my stamina and keep myself fit. I also love most sports; I am a decent badminton
player and a swimmer. A healthy mind in a healthy body!

I would like to end my speech with a little French and Spanish: Bonne soirée à tous!, i.e. Have a good
evening all! and Muchas gracias, i.e. Many thanks.

Over to you, Mr Toastmaster.
